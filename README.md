# form-validator-vanillaJS
I made this Form validator using vanilla Javascript.  It doesn't send information anywhere, I just made this page in order to practice manipulating DOM elements, 'if' statements and other javascript stuff. It's my first webpage using JS.

It's deployed on GitHub pages: https://athosfranco.github.io/form-validator-vanillaJS/

PS: It's in Portuguese.
