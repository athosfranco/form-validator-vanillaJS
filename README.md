# form-validator-vanillaJS
I made this Form validator using vanilla Javascript.  The form does not send the information anywhere, I just made this page in order to practice manipulating DOM elements, 'if' statements and other javascript stuff.

It's deployed on GitHub pages: https://athosfranco.github.io/form-validator-vanillaJS/
